# Ascent methods and selection rationale

[简体中文](ascent-options.md) | [English](ascent-options.en.md)

**The default is no averaging with a 10 m peak/valley reversal threshold.** Across the twenty trail activities tested, this method was closest overall to Garmin's displayed totals and avoided further suppression of short hills by window averaging. Other windows remain explicit options.

## Comparison

All methods used the same original FIT coordinates and elevations for twenty activities, compared against Garmin's displayed ascent and descent. Mean absolute difference is the average of the absolute differences for individual activities; platform totals are not terrain ground truth.

| Method | Mean absolute ascent difference (m) | Mean absolute descent difference (m) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Legacy 100 m window | 110.5 | 111.3 |
| **No averaging + 10 m threshold (default)** | **71.4** | **71.9** |
| 40 m averaging + 10 m threshold | 105.9 | 107.0 |
| 20 m averaging + 10 m threshold | 88.6 | 89.7 |
| 10 m averaging + 10 m threshold | 79.1 | 79.9 |

Ascent for three race routes is shown below in metres. All five methods used the same input for each route and produced identical distances.

| Route | Legacy 100 m | No averaging + 10 m | 40 m + 10 m | 20 m + 10 m | 10 m + 10 m |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Tiandi Liubai 100K | 5331.6 | 5965.5 | 5521.0 | 5768.6 | 5852.6 |
| Dajingmen DGW100K | 3635.0 | 3729.0 | 3575.0 | 3651.8 | 3680.8 |
| Dajingmen MGW50K | 1900.8 | 1960.0 | 1867.8 | 1929.3 | 1949.9 |

Comparison revisions: `28270dc` for legacy, `461ace7` for no averaging, and `dd4b95e` for the 40/20/10 m windows. The current default has returned to no averaging. Only aggregate personal activity results are published. The MGW50K source is not distributed with the repository; all methods used the same copy with 59 missing elevations linearly interpolated by distance across gaps of approximately 835 m and 34 m. This cannot recover missing terrain detail.

## Why Tiandi Liubai differs

No averaging adds approximately 634 m relative to legacy, with **77.9% of that difference between CP3 and CP6**. Inspection found no confirmed isolated large spikes to remove or elevation jumps at CP boundaries. Independent turning-point accumulation also returned 5965.47 m.

The difference mainly involves continuous undulations crossing the 10 m threshold. For example, a 12.81 m descent becomes a local drop of approximately 7.73 m after 40 m averaging, potentially removing a confirmed downward reversal. Independent elevation data is still needed to establish whether these undulations are real.

Additional trials produced 5290.0 m with a 60 m window and 10 m threshold, and 4895.4 m with a 100 m window and 10 m threshold. Resampling every 5 m without averaging, retaining the threshold, produced 5935.7 m. Agreement with the reported COROS total of roughly 5300 m does not establish accuracy or justify deleting points or tuning parameters.

## Selecting a method

No additional settings are needed for the default, which is equivalent to:

```json
{
  "ascent_method": "hysteresis",
  "ascent_smoothing_m": 0,
  "ascent_threshold_m": 10
}
```

- **No averaging + 10 m threshold:** retains extrema from cleaned source elevations; noise exceeding the threshold may still count as ascent.
- **Explicit averaging:** set `ascent_smoothing_m` to a positive value such as 10, 20, or 40. Averaging can suppress real short hills. Windows are full width: 40 m means 20 m on each side.
- **Window method:** select `ascent_method: "window"` and `ascent_smoothing_m: 100`, without reversal filtering. The current implementation includes boundary fixes and need not reproduce the legacy figures in the tables.

The 10 m threshold applies to cumulative reversal, not adjacent-point elevation differences. Display profiles independently use 5 m sampling and 20 m averaging; duplicate handling and isolated spike correction remain enabled by default. See the [model](model.en.md#ascent-and-descent) for details and [configuration](configuration.en.md#previous-window-method-and-explicit-filtering) for settings.
